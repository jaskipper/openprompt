# Openprompt
A simple Teleprompt web app.

## How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser (locally or from a host), enter **Edit** mode, paste the text you want to prompt, click on **Done** and start using it.

To save the prompt for later use, while in **Edit** mode simply save the webpage (by hitting ` ctrl + s ` on PC or ` cmd + s ` on a mac). The saved page (along with the accompanying directory) can act as a standalone prompter.

You can find the webapp hosted [here](http://www.sawmac.com/openprompt/) and [here](http://mohsend.github.io/openprompt).
